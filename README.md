# Forest Change

This is the code for calculating forest change from two different pics downloaded from google earth using image processing.

### Prerequisites

Matlab for running .m file or Matlab runtime for generated .exe 

### Installing

steps that tell you how to get running

1.) Using .m file:-
```
--> Open Matlab and nevigate to folder coontaining main.m file.
--> Run main.m by typing main in command window in matlab.
--> When open dialoge box popup, select first image and then select second image.
--> Process images will save in that folder as img3,img4,imgf1,imgf2.
--> Output will popup as image as well as, output.png and output.txt will generate. 
--> Output.png will show ForestChange, red will show forest decrease and green will show forest increase.
--> Output.txt will show calculation and rough amount of changing forest in squarekm.
```

2.) Using ForestChange.exe :-
```
--> Run ForestChange.exe.
--> When open dialoge box popup, select first image and then select second image.
--> Process images will save in that folder as img3,img4,imgf1,imgf2.
--> Output will popup as image as well as, output.png and output.txt will generate. 
--> Output.png will show ForestChange, red will show forest decrease and green will show forest increase.
--> Output.txt will show calculation and rough amount of changing forest in squarekm.
```

## Running the tests

I have given two images 12-2012.png and 12-2015.png for example. You can use any two duration images downloaded from google earth as long as they have same area.
